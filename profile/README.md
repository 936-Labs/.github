## 936 Labs

A research lab focused on producing high-quality video models + datasets.

Problems we are solving:

- Finetuning video models
- Synthetic video generation
- Dancing. video models are terrible at making things dance (movement)
- Collisions between objects

We are trying to solve the problem of generating accurate videos that describe complex interactions between objects.
